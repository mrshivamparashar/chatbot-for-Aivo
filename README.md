How It Works
Frontend: User types a query in the chat interface.
The React app sends the query to the backend API endpoint using axios.
Backend: The server receives the query, retrieves a response from the MySQL database, and sends it back to the frontend.
Database: Stores pre-defined queries and responses. You can expand the logic to handle more complex interactions.
Response Display: The React app displays the bot's response in the chat interface.
